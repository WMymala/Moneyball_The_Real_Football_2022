# Moneyball_The_Real_Football_2022
For UCD Moneyball for 2021-2022 academic year 

Our first goal was to determine whether there is a statistically significant correlation between a player’s market value and the number of international caps that player has. In our context, international caps represent the number of appearances a player has made for their respective national team setups, only taking into account senior team selections. In collecting data for our numerical variables such as player market value and international caps, we used reliable soccer database, transfermarkt, and we used salarysport for collecting information on wages for the players included in our study. We have created a dataset for a total of 151 players, which mostly consist of players included in the latest international team setups(November 2021) of five European national teams, Spain, England, France, Germany, and Italy. We’ve included household players not included in the study for various reasons(recent retirement, injuries, exclusion, etc.) We will investigate whether relationships exist between our variables and attempt to make appropriate conclusions based on our models.
